## What is the PSLBC?

We exist to explore great books and great ideas related to “Software Leadership”. While our target audience is managers, directors, and VPs within software engineering organizations, all are welcome to come and participate. Whether you’re exploring the idea of taking on a leadership role, or simply interested in the books we read, you will be welcome to participate in our discussions. In fact, your different perspective will help us have a much more interesting discussion -- if you’re not sure you belong… you do!

## How does it work?

We meet on the first Thursday of every month (except January and July) to discuss a particular book from 6-8pm. Each month we ask for a volunteer “host” to select a book and guide the discussion. There are no strict guidelines for what sorts of books the host can select; we only expect that they be books that are directed and useful to software leaders. Not everyone present needs to have read the book, although that’s strongly recommended.

The host selects the book and comes up with their own way to prompt discussion about the book. We very much hope that each of our hosts will take a different approach to guiding discussion. They might ask questions, or share quotes or insights from the book and ask everyone to respond.

## Interested in hosting?

As with most book clubs, we hope to rotate "hosts" who will select a book that they'd love to read and guide us through the discussion. We've got more information on [hosting a great discussion](hosting.html)
