## Space Planning

One of our goals is to move the discussion around to various locations throughout Philadelphia &mdash; this will give our members a chance to visit many of the great workplaces in the city. We hope that you will be able host our meetup in your place of work, but if you can't, please let us know, and we'll work with you to find a meeting space for your discussion. We normally allow up to 20 people to register for the meetup and expect that around half will attend.


## Tips for Facilitating a Great Discussion

Below are a handful of tips that have worked well for us thus far:

- Start with a round of introductions (if the group size is amenable to it). In addition to the usual asks (name, employer, job title), consider asking a question of your own (e.g., What brought you here today?).

- Come up with a handful of questions that are relevant to the book content. They may be questions taken directly from the book, or questions that came to mind as you were reading it.

- Lead questions with relevant quotes and ideas from the book. This helps provide context for folks who may not have read the entire book.

- Extract characters or personas from the book and ask attendees to comment on them. Push to consider both positive and negative interpretations.

Here are some useful videos about facilitating discussions:
